/*
    Custom DBT Test: Interest Calculation Logic Validation
    
    Purpose: Validate that interest rate calculations follow business rules
    and that derived fields (annual_interest, new_balance) are computed correctly.
    
    Test Criteria:
    1. Interest rate must be between 0.01 (1%) and 0.025 (2.5%)
    2. Annual interest must equal original_balance * interest_rate (within rounding tolerance)
    3. New balance must equal original_balance + annual_interest
    
    This test will fail if any records violate these rules.
