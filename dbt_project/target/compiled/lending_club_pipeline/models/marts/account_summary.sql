/*
    Marts model: Account Summary with Interest Calculation
    
    Purpose: Generate final account summary with calculated interest rates
    and projected balances based on business rules.
    
    Layer: Marts (Layer 5)
    Materialization: incremental (merge strategy)
    Unique Key: account_id
    
    Business Logic:
    - Base interest rate by balance tier:
        * < $10,000: 1.0% (0.01)
        * $10,000 - $19,999: 1.5% (0.015)
        * >= $20,000: 2.0% (0.02)
    - Bonus rate: +0.5% (0.005) if customer has_loan_flag = true
    - Annual interest: balance * interest_rate, rounded to 2 decimals
    - New balance: original_balance + annual_interest, rounded to 2 decimals
    
    Incremental Strategy:
    - On first run: Process all savings accounts
    - On subsequent runs: Process only records changed since last run
    - Uses merge strategy to update existing records and insert new ones
    - Filters based on valid_from_at timestamp from upstream model
    
    Error Handling:
    - Uses COALESCE to handle NULL max values (empty table scenario)
    - Fallback to '1900-01-01' ensures all records are processed if table is empty
    - Prevents incremental load failures due to missing data
