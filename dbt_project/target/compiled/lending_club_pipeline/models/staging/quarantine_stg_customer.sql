/*
    Quarantine model for customer data validation failures
    
    Purpose: Capture and log customer records that fail validation rules
    for review and remediation. This model identifies records with data
    quality issues that prevent them from being processed in the main pipeline.
    
    Layer: Staging (Layer 2) - Quarantine
    Materialization: table (configured in dbt_project.yml)
    
    Validation Rules:
    - customer_id must be a valid integer (not null, not empty)
    - name must not be null or empty after trimming
    - has_loan must be a recognized boolean value
    
    Quarantine Reasons:
    - Invalid customer_id (null, empty, or non-numeric)
    - Missing or empty customer name
    - Invalid has_loan value (not in recognized set)
    
    Usage:
    - Review quarantined records regularly
    - Fix data quality issues at the source
    - Reprocess corrected records through the pipeline
