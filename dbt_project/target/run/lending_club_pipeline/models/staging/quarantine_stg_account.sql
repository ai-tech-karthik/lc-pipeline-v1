    Quarantine model for account data validation failures
    
    Purpose: Capture and log account records that fail validation rules
    for review and remediation. This model identifies records with data
    quality issues that prevent them from being processed in the main pipeline.
    
    Layer: Staging (Layer 2) - Quarantine
    Materialization: table (configured in dbt_project.yml)
    
    Validation Rules:
    - account_id must not be null or empty
    - customer_id must be a valid integer (not null, not empty)
    - balance must be a valid decimal number (not null, not negative)
    - account_type must not be null or empty
    
    Quarantine Reasons:
    - Invalid account_id (null or empty)
    - Invalid customer_id (null, empty, or non-numeric)
    - Invalid balance (null, empty, non-numeric, or negative)
    - Missing or empty account_type
    
    Usage:
    - Review quarantined records regularly
    - Fix data quality issues at the source
    - Reprocess corrected records through the pipeline
