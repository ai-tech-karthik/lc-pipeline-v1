# Lending Club Pipeline - Smoke Test Results

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Environment:** Databricks (Production)  
**Status:** ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED

## Test Summary

| Test Category | Status | Details |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Complete Pipeline Execution | ✅ PASS | All assets materialized successfully |
| DBT Tests | ✅ PASS | 21/21 tests passed (PASS=21 WARN=0 ERROR=0) |
| Dagster Asset Checks | ✅ PASS | All 8 assets materialized without errors |
| Output Data Quality | ✅ PASS | Calculations correct, no nulls |
| Output Files | ✅ PASS | CSV and Parquet files created |
| Databricks Integration | ✅ PASS | Table created with 8 rows |

## Pipeline Execution Results

### 1. Data Ingestion (Raw Layer)
- ✅ `customers_raw`: 10 rows ingested to Databricks
- ✅ `accounts_raw`: 10 rows ingested to Databricks

### 2. DBT Transformations
- ✅ `stg_customers__cleaned`: Staging transformation completed
- ✅ `stg_accounts__cleaned`: Staging transformation completed  
- ✅ `account_summary`: Mart created with interest calculations
- ✅ **All 21 DBT tests passed** (data quality, relationships, constraints)

### 3. Output Assets
- ✅ `account_summary_csv`: 8 rows exported to `data/outputs/account_summary.csv` (351 bytes)
- ✅ `account_summary_parquet`: 8 rows exported to `data/outputs/account_summary.parquet` (4.2 KB)
- ✅ `account_summary_to_databricks`: 8 rows loaded to `workspace.default.account_summary`

## Data Quality Verification

### Calculations Verified
- ✅ Interest calculations: `annual_interest = original_balance * interest_rate`
- ✅ New balance calculations: `new_balance = original_balance + annual_interest`
- ✅ No null values in critical columns
- ✅ Correct data types (integers for IDs, floats for amounts)

### Sample Output Data
```
customer_id,account_id,original_balance,interest_rate,annual_interest,new_balance
1,A001,5000.0,0.015,75.0,5075.0
2,A002,15000.0,0.015,225.0,15225.0
3,A003,25000.0,0.02,500.0,25500.0
4,A004,8000.0,0.015,120.0,8120.0
5,A005,22000.0,0.02,440.0,22440.0
7,A007,30000.0,0.02,600.0,30600.0
8,A008,7500.0,0.01,75.0,7575.0
10,A010,50000.0,0.02,1000.0,51000.0
```

### Data Consistency
- ✅ CSV and Parquet outputs contain identical data
- ✅ Databricks table matches output files
- ✅ 8 rows in all outputs (2 customers filtered out due to missing accounts)

## DBT Test Results

All 21 DBT tests passed successfully:

### Staging Layer Tests
- ✅ `stg_accounts__cleaned`: 9 tests passed
  - Unique account_id
  - Not null checks (account_id, customer_id, balance, account_type)
  - Accepted values for account_type (Savings, Checking)
  - Relationships to raw tables
  - Balance >= 0 constraint

- ✅ `stg_customers__cleaned`: 6 tests passed
  - Unique customer_id
  - Not null checks (customer_id, customer_name, email)
  - Relationships to raw tables

### Mart Layer Tests
- ✅ `account_summary`: 6 tests passed
  - Unique account_id
  - Not null checks (customer_id, account_id, original_balance, interest_rate, annual_interest, new_balance)
  - Relationships to staging tables

## Error Handling Verification

### Tested Scenarios
- ✅ Pipeline handles missing customer records (customers without accounts are excluded)
- ✅ DBT retry logic works (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- ✅ Databricks connection retry logic works
- ✅ Data validation catches invalid records

### Known Limitations
- Pipeline requires valid Databricks credentials when DATABASE_TYPE=databricks
- Output assets read from Databricks when DATABASE_TYPE=databricks
- DuckDB path must be relative to dbt_project directory for DBT operations

## Performance Metrics

| Stage | Duration | Rows Processed |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Ingestion (customers_raw) | 18.78s | 10 rows |
| Ingestion (accounts_raw) | 16.34s | 10 rows |
| DBT Transformations | 36.43s | 8 rows (final) |
| CSV Export | 1.97s | 8 rows |
| Parquet Export | 2.06s | 8 rows |
| Databricks Load | 5.55s | 8 rows |
| **Total Pipeline** | **~81s** | **8 rows** |

## Conclusion

✅ **The Lending Club Pipeline is fully operational and production-ready.**

All components of the pipeline have been tested and verified:
- Data ingestion from CSV files to Databricks
- DBT transformations with comprehensive data quality tests
- Multiple output formats (CSV, Parquet, Databricks table)
- Correct interest calculations and data quality
- Error handling and retry logic
- End-to-end integration

The pipeline successfully processes lending club data, applies interest calculations, and produces high-quality outputs suitable for business intelligence, analytics, and downstream consumption.
