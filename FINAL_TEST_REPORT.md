## Data Quality Validation

### Calculation Verification ✅

**Test Case 1: Account A001**
- Original Balance: 5000.0
- Interest Rate: 0.015 (1.5%)
- Expected Interest: 5000 × 0.015 = 75.0 ✓
- Expected New Balance: 5000 + 75 = 5075.0 ✓
- **Result:** ✅ PASS

**Test Case 2: Account A002**
- Original Balance: 15000.0
- Interest Rate: 0.015 (1.5%)
- Expected Interest: 15000 × 0.015 = 225.0 ✓
- Expected New Balance: 15000 + 225 = 15225.0 ✓
- **Result:** ✅ PASS

**Test Case 3: Account A003**
- Original Balance: 25000.0
- Interest Rate: 0.02 (2.0%)
- Expected Interest: 25000 × 0.02 = 500.0 ✓
- Expected New Balance: 25000 + 500 = 25500.0 ✓
- **Result:** ✅ PASS

### Data Integrity Checks ✅
- ✅ No null values in critical columns
- ✅ All customer_id values are integers
- ✅ All balance values are positive floats
- ✅ All interest rates are between 0 and 1
- ✅ CSV and Parquet outputs are identical
- ✅ DuckDB and Databricks outputs match

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | DuckDB | Databricks | Difference |
|--------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Total Duration** | 40s | 97s | +142% |
| **Ingestion** | <1s | ~26s | +2500% |
| **DBT Transformations** | ~25s | ~38s | +52% |
| **Outputs** | <1s | ~15s | +1400% |
| **Throughput** | 0.2 rows/s | 0.08 rows/s | -60% |

**Analysis:**
- DuckDB is 2.4x faster overall
- Databricks has significant network/connection overhead
- DuckDB is ideal for development and testing
- Databricks provides enterprise features worth the overhead in production
