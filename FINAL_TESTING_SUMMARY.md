## DBT Test Results

All 21 DBT tests passed in both environments:

### Staging Layer (15 tests)
- **stg_accounts__cleaned** (9 tests)
  - ✅ Unique account_id
  - ✅ Not null: account_id, customer_id, balance, account_type
  - ✅ Accepted values: account_type in ('Savings', 'Checking')
  - ✅ Relationships: customer_id → customers_raw
  - ✅ Custom: balance >= 0

- **stg_customers__cleaned** (6 tests)
  - ✅ Unique customer_id
  - ✅ Not null: customer_id, customer_name, email
  - ✅ Relationships: customer_id → customers_raw

### Mart Layer (6 tests)
- **account_summary** (6 tests)
  - ✅ Unique account_id
  - ✅ Not null: customer_id, account_id, original_balance, interest_rate, annual_interest, new_balance
  - ✅ Relationships: customer_id → stg_customers__cleaned, account_id → stg_accounts__cleaned
  - ✅ Custom: Interest calculation accuracy

---

## Data Quality Verification

### Calculations Verified ✅
```python
# Interest calculation
annual_interest = original_balance * interest_rate

# New balance calculation
new_balance = original_balance + annual_interest
```

### Sample Data Validation
```csv
customer_id,account_id,original_balance,interest_rate,annual_interest,new_balance
1,A001,5000.0,0.015,75.0,5075.0
2,A002,15000.0,0.015,225.0,15225.0
3,A003,25000.0,0.02,500.0,25500.0
```

**Verified:**
- ✅ Interest: 5000 × 0.015 = 75.0 ✓
- ✅ New Balance: 5000 + 75 = 5075.0 ✓
- ✅ No null values in any column
- ✅ Correct data types (int64 for IDs, float64 for amounts)

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | DuckDB | Databricks | Winner |
|--------|--------|------------|--------|
| Total Duration | ~20s | ~80s | DuckDB (4x faster) |
| Ingestion | 0.4s | 35s | DuckDB (87x faster) |
| DBT Transformations | 18.3s | 36.4s | DuckDB (2x faster) |
| Outputs | 0.6s | 9.6s | DuckDB (16x faster) |
| **Use Case** | Dev/Test | Production | - |

**Analysis:**
- DuckDB is significantly faster for small datasets
- Databricks overhead is justified for large-scale production workloads
- DuckDB is ideal for development and CI/CD pipelines
- Databricks provides enterprise features (security, scalability, collaboration)

## Error Handling Verification

### Tested Scenarios ✅
1. **Missing Input Files**
   - Pipeline raises FileNotFoundError with clear message
   - Logs include filename and error context

2. **Invalid Data**
   - DBT tests catch data quality issues
   - Pipeline fails fast with descriptive errors

3. **Connection Failures**
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
   - Clear error messages for troubleshooting

4. **Data Validation**
   - Empty files rejected with ValueError
   - Missing columns detected and reported
   - Null values in critical columns caught by DBT tests

## Known Limitations

1. **Path Configuration**
   - DuckDB and Dagster require absolute paths
   - Relative paths cause database location issues
   - **Solution:** Use absolute paths in `.env` file

2. **Environment Switching**
   - Must update `.env` file to switch between DuckDB and Databricks
   - **Solution:** Use environment-specific `.env` files or environment variables

3. **Databricks Costs**
   - SQL Warehouse must be running for pipeline execution
   - Incurs compute costs
   - **Solution:** Use DuckDB for development, Databricks for production only

4. **Data Volume**
   - Current test data is small (10 input rows → 8 output rows)
   - Performance characteristics may differ with larger datasets
   - **Solution:** Test with production-scale data before deployment

---

## Recommendations

### For Development
1. ✅ Use DuckDB for local development
2. ✅ Run smoke tests before committing code
3. ✅ Use absolute paths in configuration
4. ✅ Keep test data in version control

### For Production
1. ✅ Use Databricks for production workloads
2. ✅ Run full smoke test suite after deployment
3. ✅ Monitor DBT test results
4. ✅ Set up alerting for pipeline failures

### For CI/CD
1. ✅ Use DuckDB in CI/CD pipelines
2. ✅ Run smoke tests as part of build process
3. ✅ Fail build if any tests fail
4. ✅ Generate test reports for visibility
